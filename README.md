# Project4 -DUE DATE DECEMBER 8, 2019
Final group project for DIG3134C (Server Side Scripting) Two team members are Yoandy Vargas and James Sullivan.
 
## Project Requirements
1. Have a minimum of 4 pages
 Remember, no non-functional "splash" pages
The pages should work together to form a cohesive site experience.
All frameworks or libraries must be approved by me -- the majority of the material should be hand-coded.
 
2. Be styled with CSS
All pages should be styled appropriately for your site's content. Styling should be consistent between pages.
Your site should scale with differing resolutions and window sizes.
 
3. Use PHP
You should use variables
You should use conditional statements.
You should use at least one loop.
You should use Include() or Require() statements. You should use sessions.
 
4. Use a Database
You must have a database that stores user accounts and at least one other piece of information that is used on your site.
You will need to allow your users to log in, log out, and sign up for new accounts. Your passwords must be encrypted.
 
5. Include an original PHP element of your choosing. This original element is something that was not taught in class or my supplemental videos, but that you learned on your own by doing research.
Programming is very much about being able to discover and learn new things on your own. Throughout the semester, I will ask you to incorporate one extra thing on each of your assignments. This should be something that was not taught in class and that you picked up on your own. Feel free to run your idea by me if you need input!
In the submission comments, you must tell me what your original element is. If applicable, tell me how it works and what I need to do to find / use it. This allows me to return your grades faster. Failure to do so may result in loss of points.
